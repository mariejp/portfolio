# Marie Phillips - Portfolio

Welcome to the repository for my portfolio website!

I am a recent graduate of Computer Science at the University of Michigan, searching for full time Software Engineering roles.
I have experience in Web Design and UI, but I am open to learning about different focus areas.

On this site, you can view my past projects and experiences, while learning more about the skills that I have gained.

You can access the website [here](https://main.dvzipqz2w1itw.amplifyapp.com/)!


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
